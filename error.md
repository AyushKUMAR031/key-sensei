buddy in keysensei, i m facing a bug that when i type random keys(from qwerty) are not working and on pressing a key a tiny pop up is seen with text 1.0, 0.9 0.7 

From the screenshot, it looks like Key Sensei is showing some sort of **floating black box with numbers like 1.2, 1.0, 0.9, 0.7** when you press keys, and random key presses aren’t registering as intended.

This usually happens when:

* **Key Sensei’s “timing accuracy” or “WPM tracking” debug mode** is active. These numbers are likely the *time in seconds between your last key presses*.
* The app is in **practice mode with restricted keys**, so random letters from QWERTY aren’t accepted because it only expects specific ones from the prompt.
* A **JavaScript key event handler** is blocking unlisted keys and only showing that popup for timing.

**Likely causes in code**

* `keydown` or `keypress` event listener is comparing input with the expected string, and if mismatch → ignores it but still logs `timeDiff` in the UI.
* That floating “1.2” box might be part of a `debug` variable or a `console.log` output that’s being appended visually (for example, `showSpeedOverlay(lastKeyTimeDiff)`).

**How to fix**

* If you want *all* QWERTY keys to work → remove or edit the input validation so it doesn’t filter characters.
* If the timer overlay is unwanted → locate where in JS it calculates and displays this timing (search for `.innerText = time.toFixed(1)` or similar) and comment it out.
* Check if there’s a **debug mode toggle** in settings or URL query (e.g., `?debug=true`) and turn it off.

If you want, I can walk you through **finding and disabling this timing overlay in the Key Sensei code** so only the typing works without random restrictions.

Do you want me to check that in your JS file?
